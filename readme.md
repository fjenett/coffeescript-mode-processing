**CoffeeScript mode for Processing 2.0**

This is a first attempt at a "contributed mode" which is a 
system that is part of new Processing 2.0

[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) was created by [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas), inventor of [ruby-processing](https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing)

***Usage***

You need Processing 2.0 for this to run, fetch latest here:
http://processing.org/download/

Download this latest zip here:
https://github.com/fjenett/coffeescript-mode-processing/zipball/latest

Find your sketchbook folder and make a new sub-folder called "modes" if not already there

Unzip latest and from inside that folder move "CoffeeScriptMode" to "modes", like so:

    .. path-to ../Processing/
        modes/
            CoffeeScriptMode/
                .. etc ..
		libraries/
		.. sketches ..

Start Processing 2.0 ..

... in the mode menu (to the right in the editor window) you now should see "CoffeeScript".

A simple sketch looks like this:

	setup: ->
		@size 200, 200

	draw: ->
		@background 255
	
		@fill 0
		@stroke 120
	
		@rect 20, 20, @width/2, @height/2


***How does it work?***

CoffeeScript mode is based on JavaScript mode in the just released Processing 2.0 version. "Run" starts a server bound to an export folder inside your sketchs folder. It serves a generated html file containing your CS code along with Processing.js, CoffeeScript.js, jQuery and all other files to include from your sketch folder. The html file contains a short snippet of JS code that passes your CS code to the CS compiler to be converted to JavaScript. A blank Processing.js sketch is generated and the generated JS code is "mixed in" with it through jQuery.extend(). Voil√† ... a nice little soup of frameworks.

***Status***

Contributed modes are not officially introduced in Processing yet and so things might change in the future. Consider this experimental.

I'm not all satisfied with the experience at the moment ... having to type "@" before each and every Processing variable or method kinda ruins the functionalism of CoffeeScript to me. Ideas, suggestions, feedback welcome ...
