###
Loops and Comprehensions

Most of the loops you'll write in CoffeeScript will be comprehensions 
over arrays, objects, and ranges. Comprehensions replace (and compile into) 
for loops, with optional guard clauses and the value of the current array 
index. Unlike for loops, array comprehensions are expressions, and can be 
returned and assigned.

Example was adapted from the CoffeeScript reference
