Integers Floats. 

In standard Processing integers and floats are two different kinds of 
numerical data. An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number 
without a decimal point. A float is a floating-point number, which 
means it is a number that has a decimal place. Floats are used when
more precision is needed. 

In CoffeeScript, which is based on JavaScript, there is only "number",
one primitive type for all types of numeric values.
